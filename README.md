## It's my collection of algorythms that I tried to translate from step-to-step explanation to C++ code.
## Here is short guide how to use uploaded files.

## -  Sieve of Eratosthenes ##
- Count prime numbers in range 1-X where X is any number.

    - Run it in terminal **'./sieve_of_eratosthenes'**.
    - It outputs result to 'result.txt'. 
    - By default it outputs prime numbers from 1-100.
    - You can define different range of numbers. 
        - To do so add argument to run command *(this way - **'./sieve_of_eratosthenes X'**)* where **X** is maximum number in **1-X** range.

## - Leader is series ##
- Found element that in series of N elements that occurs for more than N/2 times
	- Run it in terminal **'./leader_in_series'**.
    - It outputs result to 'result.txt'. 
    - By default it outputs prime numbers from leader from 10 elements array with random numbers in range (1..3).
    - You can define different range of numbers. 
        - To do so add argument to run command *(this way - **'./sieve_of_eratosthenes X'**)* where **X** is maximum number in **1-X** range.
