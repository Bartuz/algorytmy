- Sieve of Eratosthenes - run in via terminal using *'make sieve_of_eratosthenes'*. It will output scores to 'result.txt'. **You can add argument to find prime numbers from longer than 100 range**. To do so run sieve_of_eratosthenes in this way *'make sieve_of_eratosthenes X'* where X is any number like '1', '10', '137', '9999'.
